### Project Purpose

This app is a small web app that I am creating to learn the how to effectively use the MERN stack

### Project Description

This is a project planning app. Users will be able to create an account using the sign up page, and then log into the main application using the login page.
The user will be able to create and delete projects, as well as add tasks to their specific project.

### How to use

Install all of the dependencies using npm install

### Database Setup

This program uses MongoDB

To set up the database you must connect it to your own MongoDB server using the server's URI - it is recommended that you put
this URI in a .env file using the names used in the code. The code used within the server code uses environment variables to protect sensitive information
